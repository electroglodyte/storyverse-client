  notes: 'Added direct links to all scene-related pages in the sidebar: Scene Explorer, Scene Editor, Version History, Compare Versions, Comments, Import, and Export. Each link appears as an indented item under the main Scenes menu item, providing easy access to all scene management functionality. Previous version (0.9.7): Added SceneNav component which has been removed due to route compatibility issues.'
