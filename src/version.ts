export const VERSION_NOTES = 'Simplified the story import process by replacing the multi-step importer with a streamlined JSON Import interface. Claude Desktop now handles the analysis and extraction of story elements, which are then imported directly via JSON paste. Removed deprecated analyze_story, analyze_imported_story, extract_story_elements, and import_story_with_progress tools. Fixed encoding issues in JSONImport.tsx, routes.tsx, and JSONImport.css that were causing build errors.';
