  notes: 'Refactored MCP server code into modular structure for better maintainability. Moved handlers and tools into separate files organized by functionality. Previous version (0.9.12): Moved MCP server to GitHub repository for better version control and deployment. Previous version (0.9.11): Added missing dependencies (@mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and uuid) to fix build errors. Previous version (0.9.10): Fixed StoryWorldDetailPage to properly handle duplicate records between story_worlds and storyworlds tables. Previous version (0.9.9): Added NoneVerse story world with three characters (Vex Hollow, Mira Latch, Drav Thorne) and two locations (The Hollow Market, The Recursion Library).'
