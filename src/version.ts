  notes: 'Fixed issue with story analysis showing incorrect element counts. Implemented proper success tracking that accurately reports the number of elements actually saved to the database. Added extraction summary that shows counts before saving starts, and enhanced final summary to display actual database save counts. Fixed the issue where content seemed to be cut off during analysis and added more detailed console logs for debugging. Previous version (0.9.39): Completely redesigned the story analysis process with a robust two-phase approach. Now extraction results are saved to session storage between phases, allowing the process to continue even if interrupted. Added individual item processing for database operations, detailed progress tracking with percentage indicators, and a manual continuity option between phases. This approach significantly improves reliability for larger stories and ensures extracted elements are never lost. Previous version (0.9.38): Fixed duplication in story analysis log and added automatic retry mechanism for extraction phase. Added timeout handling and unique item tracking to ensure extraction completes successfully, even for larger stories. Previous version (0.9.37): Fixed timeout issues in story analysis process by splitting it into two distinct phases (extraction and saving). The StoryAnalysisProgress component now properly handles the analysis in separate steps with improved error recovery, allowing for retry of just the saving phase if extraction was successful but saving failed. Also enhanced progress reporting with clearer phase indicators and more detailed status messages. Previous version (0.9.36): Fixed critical issue with story analysis where extracted elements were not being saved to the database. Enhanced the analyze-story Edge Function with robust database operation handling, proper error tracking, and complete support for all narrative element types including character relationships, event dependencies, and character arcs.'
