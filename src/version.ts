export const VERSION_NOTES = 'Simplified the story import process by replacing the multi-step importer with a streamlined JSON Import interface. Claude Desktop now handles the analysis and extraction of story elements, which are then imported directly via JSON paste. Fixed encoding issues in JSONImport.tsx, routes.tsx, and JSONImport.css that were causing build errors. Enhanced the JSONImport interface with attractive styled dropdowns for selecting Story World and Story, including "Create New" options for both. These enhancements improve the user experience by providing direct navigation to creation pages and better visual feedback.';
