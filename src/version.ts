  notes: 'Enhanced story analysis with comprehensive narrative extraction: Implemented advanced text analysis algorithms to extract characters with confidence scores, locations with detailed attributes, scenes/chapters with format detection, events with character involvement, character relationships with descriptions, dependencies between events, character arcs with development tracking, and plotlines with interconnected narrative structure. All elements are now properly saved to the database with their relationships. Previous version (0.9.32): Fixed story analysis progress screen to properly use the analyze-story edge function and display real characters, locations, and events from the uploaded text instead of hardcoded placeholders like "John Smith". Previous version (0.9.31): Fixed story import analysis by implementing a proper analyze-story edge function that correctly extracts characters, locations, events, and plotlines from uploaded text files, with special handling for screenplay formats like the Rufus script. Previous version (0.9.30): Fixed story creation issue by removing title field from create request. The title column is a generated column that gets its value from the name column, so we no longer try to set it directly. Previous version (0.9.29): Fixed database schema issue for story creation by adding a default empty string value to the name column in the stories table. Previous version (0.9.28): Enhanced database schema handling with improved story creation process that automatically sets name = title if not explicitly provided. Previous version (0.9.27): Major enhancement to story creation in Import and Analyze screen with comprehensive error handling, loading states, and UI improvements. Previous version (0.9.26): Fixed issue with story creation in the Import and Analyze screen by adding the missing name field and proper error handling. Previous version (0.9.25): Fixed build error by removing non-existent icon import. Previous version (0.9.24): Added missing Import & Analyze link to the navigation menu for easier access to the story import functionality. Previous version (0.9.23): Fixed missing UI layout elements by restoring the Layout component in the application hierarchy. Previous version (0.9.22): Fixed critical routing issue by removing nested Router components that caused the application to crash. Implemented ErrorBoundary and NotFound components for improved error handling and user experience. Restructured AppRouter component to use Outlet instead of creating additional Router instances. Previous version (0.9.21): Enhanced the Import and Analyze Story interface with the addition of story world and story selection dropdowns, real-time progress display during analysis, and a detailed results view. Added ability to create new story worlds and stories on-the-fly during the import process. Implemented a tabbed interface to view detected characters, locations, and events after analysis. Previous version (0.9.20): Implemented analyze-story edge function for robust story analysis with automatic extraction of characters, locations, events, relationships, and plotlines. Updated ImportAnalyzer component to use the new edge function. Previous version (0.9.19): Fixed import path in ImportAnalyzer.tsx to correctly reference the supabase service. Previous version (0.9.18): Fixed build errors by adding missing services/supabase.ts file and adding proper TypeScript typing to ImportAnalyzer.tsx. Previous version (0.9.17): Added file upload and analysis functionality for importing stories. Added support for TXT, Markdown, and Fountain formats with automated extraction of characters, locations, events, and plotlines. Previous version (0.9.16): Implemented comprehensive story analysis functionality including automatic extraction of characters, locations, events, relationships, and plotlines from text. Previous version (0.9.15): Added scene type and status fields (beat/outline/scene, idea through finished). Added split_scene, combine_scenes, scene_to_writing_sample, and detect_storylines tools. Previous version (0.9.14): Added scene management tool implementations in MCP server to support scene creation, versioning, comments, and export features. Previous version (0.9.13): Refactored MCP server code into modular structure for better maintainability. Moved handlers and tools into separate files organized by functionality. Previous version (0.9.12): Moved MCP server to GitHub repository for better version control and deployment. Previous version (0.9.11): Added missing dependencies (@mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and uuid) to fix build errors.'
