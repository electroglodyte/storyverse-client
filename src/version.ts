Previous update (0.9.6): Fixed JSON Import functionality by creating a new "import-story" Edge Function that properly handles the JSON data from Claude\'s story analysis. Updated the JSONImport component to use the correct Edge Function and parameter handling, resolving the "Failed to send a request to the Edge Function" error that was occurring during import attempts.';
