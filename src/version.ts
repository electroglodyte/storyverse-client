  notes: 'FLOW FIX: Added an extraction completion flag to guarantee the extraction review screen is always shown even with fast analyses. Previous version (0.9.54): Fixed issue where extraction completion screen was skipped for fast analyses. User will now always see the extraction results and explicitly choose to continue to saving.'
