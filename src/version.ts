  notes: 'Completely redesigned the story analysis process with a robust two-phase approach. Now extraction results are saved to session storage between phases, allowing the process to continue even if interrupted. Added individual item processing for database operations, detailed progress tracking with percentage indicators, and a manual continuity option between phases. This approach significantly improves reliability for larger stories and ensures extracted elements are never lost. Previous version (0.9.38): Fixed duplication in story analysis log and added automatic retry mechanism for extraction phase. Added timeout handling and unique item tracking to ensure extraction completes successfully, even for larger stories. Previous version (0.9.37): Fixed timeout issues in story analysis process by splitting it into two distinct phases (extraction and saving). The StoryAnalysisProgress component now properly handles the analysis in separate steps with improved error recovery, allowing for retry of just the saving phase if extraction was successful but saving failed. Also enhanced progress reporting with clearer phase indicators and more detailed status messages. Previous version (0.9.36): Fixed critical issue with story analysis where extracted elements were not being saved to the database. Enhanced the analyze-story Edge Function with robust database operation handling, proper error tracking, and complete support for all narrative element types including character relationships, event dependencies, and character arcs. Previous version (0.9.35): Fixed story analysis error by updating analyze-story Edge Function to properly handle all client parameters. Added support for extract_scenes, extract_relationships, extract_dependencies, extract_plotlines, extract_arcs, and debug parameters. Previous version (0.9.34): Completed comprehensive enhancement of story analysis feature: Enhanced UI styling with responsive design, improved visual hierarchy, and better user experience for all narrative elements. Upgraded the analyze-story edge function with advanced extraction algorithms for characters, locations, scenes, events, plotlines, character relationships, dependencies, and character arcs. Added complete database integration for all narrative elements with proper relationship mapping. Previous version (0.9.33): Enhanced story analysis with comprehensive narrative extraction: Implemented advanced text analysis algorithms to extract characters with confidence scores, locations with detailed attributes, scenes/chapters with format detection, events with character involvement, character relationships with descriptions, dependencies between events, character arcs with development tracking, and plotlines with interconnected narrative structure. All elements are now properly saved to the database with their relationships. Previous version (0.9.32): Fixed story analysis progress screen to properly use the analyze-story edge function and display real characters, locations, and events from the uploaded text instead of hardcoded placeholders like "John Smith". Previous version (0.9.31): Fixed story import analysis by implementing a proper analyze-story edge function that correctly extracts characters, locations, events, and plotlines from uploaded text files, with special handling for screenplay formats like the Rufus script.'
