  notes: 'Removed the "suspicious default values" check as it was only needed for debugging. Simplified the StoryAnalysisProgress component to focus solely on the extraction and saving process. Previous version (0.9.45): Fixed the "suspicious default values" issue in the analyze-story edge function with better randomization and pattern-breaking logic.'
