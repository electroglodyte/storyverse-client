  notes: 'Completed comprehensive enhancement of story analysis feature: Enhanced UI styling with responsive design, improved visual hierarchy, and better user experience for all narrative elements. Upgraded the analyze-story edge function with advanced extraction algorithms for characters, locations, scenes, events, plotlines, character relationships, dependencies, and character arcs. Added complete database integration for all narrative elements with proper relationship mapping. Previous version (0.9.33): Enhanced story analysis with comprehensive narrative extraction: Implemented advanced text analysis algorithms to extract characters with confidence scores, locations with detailed attributes, scenes/chapters with format detection, events with character involvement, character relationships with descriptions, dependencies between events, character arcs with development tracking, and plotlines with interconnected narrative structure. All elements are now properly saved to the database with their relationships. Previous version (0.9.32): Fixed story analysis progress screen to properly use the analyze-story edge function and display real characters, locations, and events from the uploaded text instead of hardcoded placeholders like "John Smith". Previous version (0.9.31): Fixed story import analysis by implementing a proper analyze-story edge function that correctly extracts characters, locations, events, and plotlines from uploaded text files, with special handling for screenplay formats like the Rufus script. Previous version (0.9.30): Fixed story creation issue by removing title field from create request. The title column is a generated column that gets its value from the name column, so we no longer try to set it directly. Previous version (0.9.29): Fixed database schema issue for story creation by adding a default empty string value to the name column in the stories table. Previous version (0.9.28): Enhanced database schema handling with improved story creation process that automatically sets name = title if not explicitly provided. Previous version (0.9.27): Major enhancement to story creation in Import and Analyze screen with comprehensive error handling, loading states, and UI improvements. Previous version (0.9.26): Fixed issue with story creation in the Import and Analyze screen by adding the missing name field and proper error handling. Previous version (0.9.25): Fixed build error by removing non-existent icon import.'
