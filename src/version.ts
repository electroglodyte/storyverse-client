export const VERSION_NOTES = 'Simplified the story import process by replacing the multi-step importer with a streamlined JSON Import interface. Claude Desktop now handles the analysis and extraction of story elements, which are then imported directly via JSON paste. Fixed encoding issues in JSONImport.tsx, routes.tsx, and JSONImport.css that were causing build errors. Added dropdown menus to JSONImport for selecting Story World and Story. This enhances the user experience by allowing imported data to be directly linked to existing content.';
