  notes: 'Updated analyze-story Edge Function with comprehensive error handling and logging. Added robust debugging to each extraction step, ensuring no default values are returned. Function now checks and validates each extraction step individually, with fallback mechanisms and detailed logs. Additionally, added verification to prevent the suspicious default values (5,2,0,3,2) pattern and improved response objects to include more detailed error information when needed. Previous version (0.9.42): Completely rebuilt story analysis with a clean slate approach. Implemented pattern detection to identify suspicious default values (5,2,0,3,2), completely bypassed session storage to avoid caching issues, and added extended validation of extraction results. Each extraction now uses a unique request ID and bypass_cache parameter to ensure fresh data from the edge function. Force reloading the page when requesting a new extraction ensures no browser-level caching can interfere. Detailed console logging traces the entire extraction and saving process.'
