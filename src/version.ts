  notes: 'Fixed StoryWorldDetailPage to properly handle duplicate records between story_worlds and storyworlds tables. Previous version (0.9.9): Added NoneVerse story world with three characters (Vex Hollow, Mira Latch, Drav Thorne) and two locations (The Hollow Market, The Recursion Library). Previous version (0.9.8): Added direct links to all scene-related pages in the sidebar: Scene Explorer, Scene Editor, Version History, Compare Versions, Comments, Import, and Export. Each link appears as an indented item under the main Scenes menu item, providing easy access to all scene management functionality.'
