  notes: 'Completely rebuilt story analysis with a clean slate approach. Implemented pattern detection to identify suspicious default values (5,2,0,3,2), completely bypassed session storage to avoid caching issues, and added extended validation of extraction results. Each extraction now uses a unique request ID and bypass_cache parameter to ensure fresh data from the edge function. Force reloading the page when requesting a new extraction ensures no browser-level caching can interfere. Detailed console logging traces the entire extraction and saving process. Previous version (0.9.41): Added comprehensive debugging and fixed the persistent issue with incorrect element counts. Implemented a "Force New Extraction" feature to ensure fresh analysis when needed. Added extraction timestamps for tracking when analysis was performed, added extensive logging throughout the process, and fixed validation of extraction results. Now displays actual counts based on successfully saved database entries. Previous version (0.9.40): Fixed issue with story analysis showing incorrect element counts. Implemented proper success tracking that accurately reports the number of elements actually saved to the database.'
