  notes: 'Added comprehensive debugging and fixed the persistent issue with incorrect element counts. Implemented a "Force New Extraction" feature to ensure fresh analysis when needed. Added extraction timestamps for tracking when analysis was performed, added extensive logging throughout the process, and fixed validation of extraction results. Now displays actual counts based on successfully saved database entries. Previous version (0.9.40): Fixed issue with story analysis showing incorrect element counts. Implemented proper success tracking that accurately reports the number of elements actually saved to the database. Added extraction summary that shows counts before saving starts, and enhanced final summary to display actual database save counts. Fixed the issue where content seemed to be cut off during analysis and added more detailed console logs for debugging. Previous version (0.9.39): Completely redesigned the story analysis process with a robust two-phase approach. Now extraction results are saved to session storage between phases, allowing the process to continue even if interrupted. Added individual item processing for database operations, detailed progress tracking with percentage indicators, and a manual continuity option between phases. This approach significantly improves reliability for larger stories and ensures extracted elements are never lost.'
