  notes: 'Added scene management tool implementations in MCP server to support scene creation, versioning, comments, and export features. Previous version (0.9.13): Refactored MCP server code into modular structure for better maintainability. Moved handlers and tools into separate files organized by functionality. Previous version (0.9.12): Moved MCP server to GitHub repository for better version control and deployment. Previous version (0.9.11): Added missing dependencies (@mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled, and uuid) to fix build errors. Previous version (0.9.10): Fixed StoryWorldDetailPage to properly handle duplicate records between story_worlds and storyworlds tables.'
