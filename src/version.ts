  notes: 'Updated client code to detect both the original (5,2,0,3,2) and new (4,3,0,3,2) suspicious value patterns during story analysis. Enhanced pattern detection to show the actual count values in console logs for better debugging. Added verbose logging for all element counts to help diagnose extraction issues. Previous version (0.9.43): Updated analyze-story Edge Function with comprehensive error handling and logging. Added robust debugging to each extraction step, ensuring no default values are returned. Function now checks and validates each extraction step individually, with fallback mechanisms and detailed logs. Additionally, added verification to prevent the suspicious default values (5,2,0,3,2) pattern and improved response objects to include more detailed error information when needed.'
